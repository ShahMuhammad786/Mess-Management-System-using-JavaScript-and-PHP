	You have to load the database in your pc with name 'mms-db' within the MMS-Project folder.
	Your mysql database server will be on in your pc while accessing the application.
	Then you have to run file in your localhost which is in the same directory that is 'login.php';
	And Then you can enter to the application and can operate all the things.

	Currently there are two users and two admins that I had in the database.
	That's why I am providing the usernames and passwords for accessing.
		Users:
			username: 051-19-0001 pass: 123456789
			username: 021-19-0022 pass: 123456789
		Admins:
			username: 051-19-0001 pass: 123456
			username: 021-19-0022 pass: 123456


	These Instruction are for the running application in the localhost.
	If still you have any problems with the accessing or flow of aaplication then you can see the video
